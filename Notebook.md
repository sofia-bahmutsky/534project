Notebook for tracking the 534 project

Jan 26: We attempted to register for car2go API, and Google Maps. However, car2og did not grant access for unknown reasons, and 
Google Maps is not free. We could not proceed with our original ideas, and decided to think of something else.

Jan 27: Spoke to Dr. Narayan todat about the issues we are facing. He told us to consider our other ideas, we want to use a weather
or climate API data to compare and track changes in climate and weather across Canada. We emailed Dr. Narayan our new proposal,
he said it was good to start working on it. 

Jan 27 evening: research about possible apis to use, we found weatherstack.com which is free and very comprehensive. We also found some
useful R libraries for plotting of the style which we are hoping to do.
